## Summary

<!-- Describe the change and whether it affects deployment, governance, or release flow. -->

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] I reviewed [documentation/deployment-checklist.md](../documentation/deployment-checklist.md).
- [ ] Required checks are green: format, clippy, full tests, benchmarks, and upgrade harness.
- [ ] Event schema is locked with the canonical schema test.
- [ ] Governance requirements are documented: threshold keys and pause policy.
- [ ] The environment registry has been updated for each affected network.
- [ ] Testnet validation was completed before any mainnet promotion.
- [ ] Post-deploy validation includes metadata view, health check, and event emission smoke test.
- [ ] Mainnet steps are explicit and repeatable, or this PR is not a mainnet release.

## Notes

<!-- Add contract IDs, network, release notes, or follow-up tasks here. -->
